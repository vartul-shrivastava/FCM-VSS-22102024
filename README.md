## Overview

**FCM-VSS** (Fuzzy Cognitive Maps - Visualizer, Simulator, Summarizer) is a comprehensive web-based toolkit designed for Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) management. The toolkit integrates key features such as AES-GCM encryption for secure data handling, real-time Kosko simulations, and AI-powered inference using locally hosted Ollama models. It supports multiple functionalities like visualization, simulation, and what-if scenario analysis to facilitate a robust, secure, and advanced FCM management environment.

## Key Features
- **AES-GCM Encryption**: Ensures secure project management, preventing unauthorized access to FCM configurations and snapshots.
- **Kosko Simulation**: Provides support for Original Kosko, Modified Kosko, and Rescaled Kosko inference mechanisms for dynamic FCM simulations.
- **AI-powered Summarization**: Uses AI models hosted via Ollama to generate detailed summaries of FCM configurations based on node statistics, Kosko simulation convergence, and what-if analysis.
- **Checkpoint and Snapshot Management**: Allows users to save, load, and manage FCM configurations and track project progress through checkpoints and snapshots.
- **Interactive Playground**: Enables real-time modifications of FCM networks, including node/edge addition and deletion, with drag-and-drop functionality and keyboard shortcuts.
- **Customizable Transfer Functions**: Supports multiple transfer functions (Sigmoid, Tanh, Bivalent, Trivalent) and node activation patterns for advanced simulations.
